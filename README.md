## 2018 R&D Showcase abstract

This is the abstract for my submission to the 2018 R&D Showcase. 
Of course, the **School of Engineering** does not provide a proper [LaTeX source file](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/student-participant-information) so instead I'm using this which I created several years ago.

It's fairly close to what they desire and any differences are probably not going to be noticed.

## Remotes

This document exists in several places

1. [Github](https://github.com/skulumani/2018_RD_Abstract)
2. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/shankarkulumani/2018_rd_abstract)

and are all hopefully consistent. 
If not, be sure to use the Github repo.
